# excerpt: "Transfer learning has become a prevailing machine learning technique thanks to its superiority in learning knowledge from limited training data for prediction. In the existing works, collection and collaboration are two major approaches to realize the improvement of transfer learning performance. Even though the effectiveness of these approaches has been validated in extensive experiments, there lacks the support of theoretical analysis. Consequently, how to enhance transfer learning effectively is an open problem. In light of this, in this paper, we thoroughly and deeply study the methods of improving transfer learning performance in order to provide the guidelines for applying transfer learning in real applications. Through our proof process, critical conclusions are drawn to help learn the motivation of implementing collection and collaboration, the performance gap between collection and collaboration, and the impacts of data sharing strategies on transfer learning in collaboration. These conclusions can further build a theoretical foundation for future research on transfer learning."

3D grey image segmentation has become a promising approach to facilitate practical applications with the help of advanced deep learning models. Although a number of previous works have investigated the vulnerability of deep learning models to backdoor attack, there is no work to study the severe risk of backdoor attack on 3D grey image segmentation. To this end, we propose two backdoor attack methods on 3D grey image segmentation, including Full-control Backdoor Attack (FCBA) and Partial-control Backdoor Attack (PCBA), on 3D grey image segmentation by leveraging a frequency trigger injection function and a rotation-based label corruption function. Our proposed trigger injection function is applied to insert a 3D trigger pattern into the benign 3D grey images in the frequency domain while ensuring the invisibility of the trigger pattern. And the proposed rotation-based label corruption function is employed to yield the crafted labels with the aim of decreasing the performance of segmentation. Finally, through comprehensive experiments on a real-world dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed backdoor models, the frequency trigger injection function, and the rotation-based label corruption function.
