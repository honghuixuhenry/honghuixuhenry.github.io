title: "Efficient CityCam-to-Edge Cooperative Learning for Vehicle Counting in ITS"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022_TITS
excerpt: "Vehicle counting is a fundamental component in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) for city traffic management. Although a number of vehicle counting approaches have been proposed, their essential drawbacks limit the efficacy of vehicle counting in real applications. In this paper, we propose a CityCam-to-Edge cooperative learning framework by cooperating multiple city cameras with an edge server to count vehicles more efficiently. Our learning framework consists of a lightweight feature extraction scheme deployed on the city cameras and a vehicle counting model implemented on the edge server. We devise the lightweight feature extraction scheme by leveraging multiple convolutional layers with few kernels in the design of deep learning architecture to reduce the utilization of parameters for feature extraction, so that the city cameras’ memory consumption and the data transmission time can be greatly reduced. Moreover, we design two novel vehicle counting models, F2F-M and O2O-M, to improve the counting performance by exploiting the temporal correlation among videos captured from multiple city cameras in a frame-to-frame manner and a video-to-video manner, respectively. By combining the lightweight feature extraction scheme and the proposed vehicle counting models, we obtain two end-to-end vehicle counting models, Lite-F2F-M and Lite-O2O-M. Finally, via conducting extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Lite-F2F-M and Lite- O2O-M models outperform the state-of-the-art in terms of vehicle counting accuracy and time efficiency."
