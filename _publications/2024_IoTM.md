# excerpt: "Transfer learning has become a prevailing machine learning technique thanks to its superiority in learning knowledge from limited training data for prediction. In the existing works, collection and collaboration are two major approaches to realize the improvement of transfer learning performance. Even though the effectiveness of these approaches has been validated in extensive experiments, there lacks the support of theoretical analysis. Consequently, how to enhance transfer learning effectively is an open problem. In light of this, in this paper, we thoroughly and deeply study the methods of improving transfer learning performance in order to provide the guidelines for applying transfer learning in real applications. Through our proof process, critical conclusions are drawn to help learn the motivation of implementing collection and collaboration, the performance gap between collection and collaboration, and the impacts of data sharing strategies on transfer learning in collaboration. These conclusions can further build a theoretical foundation for future research on transfer learning."

In an era where the Internet of Things (IoT) intersects increasingly with generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), this article scrutinizes the emergent security risks inherent in this integration. We explore how generative AI drives innovation in IoT and we analyze the potential for data breaches when using generative AI and the misuse of generative AI technologies in IoT ecosystems. These risks not only threaten the privacy and efficiency of IoT systems but also pose broader implications for trust and safety in AI-driven environments. The discussion in this article extends to strategic approaches for mitigating these risks, including the development of robust security protocols, the multi- layered security approaches, and the adoption of AI technological solutions. Through a comprehensive analysis, this article aims to shed light on the critical balance between embracing AI advancements and ensuring stringent security in IoT, providing insights into the future direction of these intertwined technologies.
