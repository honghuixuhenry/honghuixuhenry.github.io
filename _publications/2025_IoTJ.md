# excerpt: "Transfer learning has become a prevailing machine learning technique thanks to its superiority in learning knowledge from limited training data for prediction. In the existing works, collection and collaboration are two major approaches to realize the improvement of transfer learning performance. Even though the effectiveness of these approaches has been validated in extensive experiments, there lacks the support of theoretical analysis. Consequently, how to enhance transfer learning effectively is an open problem. In light of this, in this paper, we thoroughly and deeply study the methods of improving transfer learning performance in order to provide the guidelines for applying transfer learning in real applications. Through our proof process, critical conclusions are drawn to help learn the motivation of implementing collection and collaboration, the performance gap between collection and collaboration, and the impacts of data sharing strategies on transfer learning in collaboration. These conclusions can further build a theoretical foundation for future research on transfer learning."

Multimodal sentiment analysis plays a critical role in numerous IoT-driven applications, such as personalized smart assistants, healthcare monitoring systems, and intelligent transportation networks, where accurate interpretation of user emotions is vital for enhancing service quality. However, a severe threat of privacy leakage in the multimodal sentiment analysis has been overlooked by previous works. To fill this gap, we propose a Differentially Private Correlated Representation Learning
(DPCRL) model to achieve privacy-preserving multimodal sentiment analysis by combining a correlated representation learning scheme with a differential privacy protection scheme. Our correlated representation learning scheme aims to achieve heterogeneous multimodal data transformation to meet the requirements of privacy-preserving multimodal sentiment analysis by learning the correlated and uncorrelated representations, where especially, a pre-determined correlation factor is employed to flexibly adjust the expected correlation among the correlated representations. The differential privacy protection scheme is used to obtain the disturbed correlated and uncorrelated representations by adding Laplace noise for Ïµ-differential privacy. In particular, the correlation factor can help alleviate the side-effect of the added Laplace noise on the sentiment prediction performance. Finally, via conducting a series of real-data experiments, we validate that our proposed DPCRL model is superior to the state of the art for privacy-preserving multimodal sentiment analysis.
