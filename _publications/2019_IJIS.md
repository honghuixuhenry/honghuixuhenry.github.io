# excerpt: "Dempster‐Shafer is widely used to address the problems of uncertainty. One assumption mentioned in this theory is that the distribution of information should be independent. In practice, the requirement cannot be fulfilled. One of the efficient methods to deal with dependent evidence is to calculate the correlation discounting. However, existing coefficient can only be applied to show the direct relation between evidence A and B but do not take the indirect relationship into consideration. To address this issue, in this paper, a new method to combine dependent evidence based on decision‐making trial and evaluation laboratory is presented, not only considering the relation between evidence A and B and the relation between evidence B and C, but also considering the transitive influence between evidence A and C. Finally, the experiments on some benchmark data sets are illustrated to show the efficiency of the proposed method."

<!-- Dempster‐Shafer is widely used to address the problems of uncertainty. One assumption mentioned in this theory is that the distribution of information should be independent.
